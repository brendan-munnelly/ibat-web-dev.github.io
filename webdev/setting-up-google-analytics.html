	<h2>About Google Analytics</h2>
	<p>Google Analytics is an online service used by some <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">27 million websites</a> around the world to monitor their user traffic.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>For websites with over 10 million visits per month, there is a paid version named Google Analytics 360 that costs &#36;150,000 annually.</li>
		<li>This Tutorial will focus only on the free or &#8216;standard&#8217; version of Google Analytics.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To use Google Analytics on your website, you:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Sign in to Google Analytics with the same email and password you use to access Gmail, YouTube or other Google service.</li>
		<li>Enter the address of the website you want to track &#8211; for example, <b>https://marysmith.github.io</b>.</li>
		<li>Google Analytics then generates a Tracking Code which contains a Tracking ID that is unique to your website.</li>
		<li>Paste the Tracking Code into all the pages of your website you want to monitor.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The Google Tracking Code is in the form of a few lines (a <i>snippet</i>) of JavaScript code. Typically, the Google Analytics Tracking Code is placed just before the closing <b>&lt;/head&gt;</b> tag of a web page.</p>

	<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-tracking-code-sample-snippet.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">

	<h3>Information collected by Google Analytics</h3>
	<p>Google Analytics provides you with two types of data about the traffic to your website:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>A little about what is happening now</b>: You can see a summary of so-called <i>real-time</i> data, such as your number of current visitors, their geographic location and which pages they are viewing.</li>
		<li><b>A lot about what happened until the day before yesterday</b>: You can view more in-depth details on <i>all previous activity</i> on your website. This includes anonymised statistical data on your website visitors, such as their age range, gender and lifestyle interests.<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>However, the free version of Google Analytics delays the display of historical data by 24-48 hours. This means that you won&#8217;t see any web traffic from yesterday and often from the day before either. So, do not be alarmed if it looks like the number of website visitors over the past two days has dropped to zero. It is just that Google Analytics is not yet displaying that data.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Your Gmail/Google Account</h3>
	<p>Do you already use one or more of Google&#8217;s online services, such as Gmail, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Maps or Google Play? If you do, you will know that you can sign in to any of these services using the same email address and password. This email/password combination is known as your <em>Google Account.</em></p>

	<p>Because Gmail is Google&#8217;s most widely-used service, the terms &#8216;Gmail Account&#8217; and &#8216;Google Account&#8217; are often used interchangeably.</p>

	<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-all-of-google-new.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">

	<p>You need a Gmail/Google Account to sign up to Google Analytics and complete this Tutorial. If you do not already have such an account, follow the instructions at the link below.</p>

<section id="google-analytics-signup" class="block-content">
	<h2>Signing up to Google Analytics</h2>
	<p>Follow the steps below to sign up as a user of Google Analytics.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Use your web browser to go to this web address:<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		<b><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/analytics</a></b><span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span><span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		A new tab will open in your web browser to display a welcome screen like that below. Near the top-right of the screen is a button named <b>Start for free</b>. Click on it.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-front-welcome.jpg" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>You are next asked to sign in to Google Analytics. Enter the same details as you would when signing in to Gmail or other Google Account.
		<ul>
			<li>First, type your Email address and click the <b>Next</b> button.</li>
			<li>And then enter your Password and click <b>Next</b> again.</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-sign-in.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>You will be shown a screen that introduces you to Google Analytics. Click the <b>Sign up</b> button at the right of this screen.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-introduction.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
	</ol>
	<p>You have now used your Gmail/Google Account to sign up as a user of Google Analytics. Your next action is to provide Google Analytics with details of the website you want to track.</p>
</section>


<section id="google-analytics-account" class="block-content">

	<h2>Creating a Google Analytics Account and Property</h2>
	<p>After you have completed the sign-up steps in the previous section, Google Analytics displays a screen named <b>Accounts</b> that begins with two sub-headings:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Setting up your account</b>: An Account is a group of tracked websites. Any one Account can contain up to 100 tracked websites.</li>
		<li><b>Setting up your property</b>: A Property is a single tracked website. Every Property belongs to an Account.</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-new-account-property-screen.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">

	<p>The terms <a href="#google-analytics-concepts">Account and Property</a> are explained later in this Tutorial.</p>
	<p>Here is how to create your first Account and Property in Google Analytics.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>You can use Google Analytics to track either a website or a mobile phone app. Leave the first setting at its default value of <b>Website</b>.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-new-account-website.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>You are now asked to enter the <b>Account Name</b> and <b>Website Name</b>. In the example below, the values &#8216;My Personal Websites&#8217; and &#8216;GitHub Website&#8217; are entered.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-property.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>The next two values you enter are under the sub-heading of <b>Setting up your property</b>, In Google Analytics, a Property is a single tracked website (or mobile phone app). Google Analytics can track a website only if you:
		<ul>
			<li>Correctly select the protocol (<b>http://</b> or <b>https://</b>). It is unlikely you will ever want to select <b>http://</b>, as this is the older, insecure protocol that should not be used on modern websites.</li>
			<li>Correctly enter the website address (such as <b>marysmith.github.io</b>). Do <i>not</i> enter a forward slash after the web address, or include the name of a folder within the address. For example, marysmith.github.io/ or marysmith.github.io/portfolio.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Here are the two steps:
		<ul>
			<li>At the right of the <b>Website URL</b> field, click the dropdown arrow and select <b>https://</b>.</li>
			<li>Next, in the <b>Website URL</b> field, type the web address of your website. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is simply another term for web address.
			<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-enter-url.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The next two fields under the Property sub-heading are optional. You can ignore them or select a value for <b>Industry Category</b> and amend the default <b>Reporting Time Zone</b>.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-category-time.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>

	</ol>

	<p>You have now completed the first two sections of this screen: <b>Setting up your account</b> and <b>Setting up your property</b>. The next section is named <b>Data Sharing Settings</b>.</p>

	<ol>

		<li>You are now shown a list of options for how you want to share your website&#8217; traffic data with Google. All the options are selected by default. You deselect one or more if you wish.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/data-sharing-settings.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		
		<li>When finished, click the <b>Get Tracking ID</b> button.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-get-tracking-id-btn.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>Google Analytics now displays its <b>Terms of Service Agreement</b>.<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		<ul>
			<li>At the top of this screen, select your country.</li>
			<li>Next, select any checkboxes contained within the text of the Agreement.</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-terms.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">
		When finished, click the <b>I Accept</b> button at the bottom.</li>
		<li>You are now shown the Google Analytics Tracking Code with the unique Tracking ID for your website.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-tracking-id.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you click anywhere within the Tracking Code area of the screen, Google Analytics selects the code. Next, right-click with the mouse and, from the pop-up menu displayed, choose the <b>Copy</b> command. You can then paste the Google Analytics Tracking Code into your web page or pages.</p>
	<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/copy-paste-tracking-code.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">
</section>


<section id="google-analytics-paste" class="block-content">
	<h2>Pasting your Google Analytics Code into a web page</h2>
	<p>You will need to paste the Google Analytics Tracking Code with its unique Tracking ID into <em>every web page</em> on your website that you want to track.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Copy the Tracking Code from Google Analytics &#8211; or from a web page that already contains it.</li>
		<li>In your text editor, open the web page into which you want to paste the Tracking Code.</li>
		<li>Typically, the Tracking Code is placed just before the closing <b>&lt;/head&gt;</b> tag.<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		In your web page, click in that position, press ENTER once or twice to open a new line or two.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-paste-code-1.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>And then paste the Google Analytics Tracking Code.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-paste-code-2.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
	</ol>
	<p>When finished, you will need to save your web pages and upload them to your website on the Internet. Google Analytics cannot track web pages that exist only on your local computer.</p>
</section>


<section id="google-analytics-test" class="block-content">

	<h2>Testing that Google Analytics is tracking your web pages</h2>
	<p>Follow these steps to verify that the Google Analytics Tracking Code you have pasted into a web page or pages is working.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>After you have pasted the Tracking Code into a web page or pages, save the page(s), and upload them to your website on the Internet.</li>
		<li>In one tab of your web browser, display and reload the web page into which you have pasted the Google Analytics Tracking Code. In another tab, display your Google Analytics home page.<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		In the blue box at the right of the Google Analytics home page, you should see that you have at least one Active User (current or real-time visitor) at your website.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-admin-real-time-1.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>To see further information, click the <b>Realtime</b> option in the vertical list of menu options at the left of the screen, and then click the <b>Overview</b> sub-option. 
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-real-time-1.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">
		You will see a screen that looks like that below.

<section id="google-analytics-concepts" class="block-content">

	<h2>Google Analytics: Accounts, Properties and Views</h2>
	<p>To correctly set up and manage Google Analytics for several websites, it is important to understand the following key terms:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Google Analytics Account</li>
		<li>Google Analytics Property</li>
		<li>Google Analytics View</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>About Google Analytics Accounts</h3>
	<p>You sign in to Google Analytics with your Gmail/Google Account &#8211; a combination of an email address and password that gives you access to the online service. Once you have signed in, however, the word &#8216;Account&#8217; you see on Google Analytics screens has a very different meaning.</p>

	<p>Within Google Analytics, the word &#8216;Account:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Does <i>not</i> refer to the Gmail/Google Account you used to sign in.</li>
		<li>Does refer to the client for whom you are building websites.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When you build several websites with different web addresses for a single client, you can group these different websites together into one, convenient Google Account.</p>

	<p>In other words, a Google Analytics Account is a group of tracked websites that share something in common. Typically, that common factor is that they were all created for the same client.</p>

	<p>With a single Gmail/Google Account (email address/password), you sign up as a Google Analytics user, and then create up to 100 different Google Analytics Accounts &#8211; that is, 100 groups of tracked websites.</p>

	<h3>About Google Analytics Properties</h3>
	<p>In Google Analytics, a <em>Property</em> is a single tracked website (or mobile phone app). Every Google Analytics Property belongs to a Google Analytics Account, and any one Google Analytics Account can contain up to 50 Google Analytics Properties.</p>

	<p>In summary, you can create 100 different Google Analytics Accounts, each one of which can contain 50 Properties. That means, with a single Gmail/Google Account, Google Analytics will allow you to track 100 x 50 = 500 different websites.</p>

	<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-tracking-code-sample-snippet-1.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">

	<p>When you look at the unique Tracking ID within each Google Analytics Tracking Code, you can see that it consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen (-). In the example of <b>UA-122243940-1</b>, the <b>122243940</b> part is the Account number, and the <b>1</b> at the end is the Property number. The letters <b>UA</b> stand for Universal Analytics.</p>

	<h3>About Google Analytics Views</h3>
	<p>Google Analytics allows you to create on-screen reports called <i>Views</i> that show selected information about traffic to a particular Property (tracked website). For any one Google Analytics Property, you can create up to 25 Views. An example of a View in Google Analytics would be one that displays web traffic only by female visitors from Australia, in the age range 25-34, who accessed a Property (tracked website) using Apple mobile devices.</p>

	<p>Every time you create a new Property (that is, track a new website), Google Analytics automatically creates a &#8216;Show Me Everything&#8217; View for that Property which it calls <b>All Web Site Data</b>.</p>

	<p>If you look at your Google Analytics home screen, you can see near the top-left a dropdown list showing your currently selected Google Analytics Property and View. As you have created only one such Account/Property so far, it should look as shown below. Click the dropdown list to see your Google Account/Property/View structure in full.</p>

	<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-admin-structure.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">
	
	<h3>Working with multiple Google Accounts and Properties</h3>
	<p>Over time, as you build more websites and need to track their visitors, you have two choices in how you manage those websites in Google Analytics:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>One Google Account/Many Google Properties</b>: One approach would be to use the <i>same</i> Account to contain all the websites you track, with each new website added as a Property to that Account.
		<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		If you are building websites only for your employer or for one other organisation, this is the recommended way of organising Accounts and Properties.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-account-property-2.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>

		<li><b>One Google Account/One Google Property</b>: Another approach would be, that for every new website you want to track, you create one new Account and one new Property. With this approach, you would probably give the same name to both the Account and the Property.<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		If you are building websites for different clients, this is the recommended way of organising Accounts and Properties.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-account-property-1.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
	</ul>

	<p>As a general rule, it&#8217;s probably best to follow the simpler One Account/One Property structure unless there is a very good reason to group several Properties within a single Account. The most common such reason for grouping multiple websites would be that they are all created for the same client organisation.</p>
</section>

<section id="google-analytics-more" class="block-content">

	<h2>Using multiple Gmail/Google Accounts with Google Analytics</h2>
	<p>If you have more than one Gmail/Google Account, it may happen that, over time, you use different Gmail/Google Accounts to work with Google Analytics.</p>

	<p>For example:
		<ul>
			<li>You have two Gmail/Google Analytics Accounts: <b>marysmith@gmail.com</b> and <b>msmith99@gmail.com</b>.</li>
			<li>For some websites, you set up Google Analytics tracking with the first Gmail/Google Account. For other websites, you use your second Gmail/Google Account.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<p>Now, you sign in to Google Analytics as follows:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>You go to <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>https://www.google.com/analytics</b></a></li>
		<li>You then click the <b>Sign in to Analytics</b> button on the welcome screen.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-sign-in-again.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>You sign in with your Gmail/Google Account of <b>marysmith@gmail.com</b>.</li>
		<li>However, in Google Analytics, you notice that you can see web traffic data only for some of your websites &#8211; but not others. Why are some tracked websites missing?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>When you sign in to Google Analytics as <b>marysmith@gmail.com</b>, you will see only those websites for which you set up tracking as <b>marysmith@gmail.com</b>. The likely reason some websites are missing is that  you used your other Gmail/Google Account (<b>msmith99@gmail.com</b>) to set up Google Analytics tracking for them.</p>

	<p>Within Google Analytics, you can view all your Gmail/Google Accounts, and switch between different ones, by clicking the user icon at the top-right of any Google Analytics screen, and then selecting the relevant Gmail/Google Account.</p>
	<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-user-drop-down.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid">

</section>


<section id="google-analytics-further" class="block-content">
	<h2>Adding further websites to Google Analytics</h2>
	<p>After you have signed up to Google Analytics and added at least one website for tracking, here are the steps to track additional websites.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Use your Gmail/Google Account to sign in to <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>https://www.google.com/analytics</b></a>.</li>
		<li>At the left of the Google Analytics home screen is a vertical menu of options. The last option is named <b>Admin</b> and has a gears icon beside it. Click this option.
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-admin-menu-option.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>
		<li>Your next step depends on whether you want to create a new Account to contain the new website you want to track. Or instead want to add that website to a Google Analytics Account that already exists:

		<ul>
			<li><b>New Account</b>: Typically, you will choose this option when you want to track a website for a new client.<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>In the first (left) column, click the <b>Create Account</b> button.</li>
			<li><b>Existing Account</b>: If the new website is for an existing client, and you have grouped together that client&#8217;s other websites within a Gooogle Account, you will typically choose this option.<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
			In the second (centre) column, select the relevant Account from the dropdown list, and then click the <b>Create Property</b> button.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="assets/img/google-analytics/ga-add-new-website.png" alt="Tutorial: Set up Google Analytics" class="img-fluid"></li>

		<li>Next, enter the details for the relevant website. If you have chosen to create a new Account, you will need to enter the <b>Account Name</b>. Complete the Terms of Service and, when finished, click the <b>I Accept</b> button.<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		You are now shown the Google Analytics Tracking Code with the unique Tracking ID for your website.</li>

		<li>Click anywhere within the Tracking Code area of the screen, and then paste the code into your web page or pages.</li>
	</ol>

<section id="google-analytics-share" class="block-content">

	<h2>Sharing Google Analytics data with others</h2>
	<p>As a web designer/developer, you will often be the person who creates the Google Analytics Tracking Code for the websites you build. However, others will want to be able to view the web traffic information collected by Google Analytics. For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Team colleagues</b> in the marketing and IT departments of your organisation.</li>
		<li><b>External clients</b> for whom you built websites.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Follow these steps to share Google Analytics data with one or more other people.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Sign in to Google Analytics and, on your home screen, click the <b>Admin</b> menu option at the lower-left.</li>

		<li>On the next screen displayed you can see three columns of options: Account, Property and View. Each column contains an option with the same name: <b>User Management</b>.
